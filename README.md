### Other files :

Four other files are aviables :

#### take_photo.py

This allows you to take a picture of you and save it as <file>.image.

#### read_photo.py

This allows you to see a picture that you've take using take_photo.py (terminal needs to be resized).

#### take_video.py

#### read_video.py

You see it, it read a .video file (and terminal needs to be resized)
